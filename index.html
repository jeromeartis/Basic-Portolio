        <p>Jerome Artis is an enthusiastic, charismatic individual who was born in Brooklyn New York. Compelled to make his parent proud and make his own path, he joined the United States Navy. He severed for twelve honorable years, while starting his own family and attending school full time in San Diego, California and Atlanta, Georgia. His first start in technology came a few months after getting out of the military. He was offered a level II position as User System Support Specialist where he provides deskside/PBX support to end users.</p>
        <p>After telling everyone that Lorem ipsum, the nonsensical text that comes with PageMaker, only looks like Latin but actually says nothing, I heard from Richard McClintock, publication director at the Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, who had enlightening news:</p>
        <p>What I find remarkable is that this text has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since some printed in the 1500s took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book; it has survived not only four centuries of letter-by-letter resetting but even the leap into electronic typesetting, essentially unchanged except for an occasional 'ing' or 'y' thrown in. It's ironic that when the then-understood Latin was scrambled, it became as incomprehensible as Greek; the phrase 'it's Greek to me' and 'greeking' have common semantic roots!</p>
